# Cricket-Score-Predictor-Using-Machine-Learning
A cricket score and Win predictor Sytem. That uses Linear Regression, Random Forest, A simple Neuarl Network and Elastic Net. 
You can use increase the layers of the neural network. You can also increase the number of ephochs .The Neural Network Model was trained pretty quickly. For random forest try using label encoder rather than using one-hot encoding . I tried to work with label encoder first 
first but we were facing some problem. I actually wanted so the user can see the original value but pass the label encoder values to score prediction and win prediction function parameters . I deleted those code since I was really mad about it not working 
(now I am regretting it). I am not a PRO coder . So, taken a lot of help from AI. 
I have only used  pre-built model. In that sense, it's a noob level project and anyone with the basic understanding of python can understand the code.
